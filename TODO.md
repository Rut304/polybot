### 🐛 BUGS TO INVESTIGATE

- [x] **FEE CALCULATION BUG** 💰 (INVESTIGATED - Data Issue)
  - Balance Details modal shows $332+ in "Total Fees Paid"
  - **Root Cause**: `stats_json.total_fees_paid` in `polybot_simulation_stats` table has accumulated fees from previous sessions
  - **Solution**: User needs to click "Reset Simulation" in Settings to clear old data
  - The Reset endpoint properly initializes `stats_json` with `total_fees_paid: '0.00'`
  - Files checked:
    - `/admin/src/components/StatDetailModal.tsx` - Frontend display logic ✓
    - `/admin/src/app/api/simulation/reset/route.ts` - Reset logic correctly clears fees ✓
    - `/src/simulation/paper_trader_realistic.py` - Fee accumulation logic ✓
  - **Note**: Not a code bug - just stale data from previous sessions

  - Need to implement actual order placement for single-platform arbitrage
  - Wire up Polymarket API for live order execution (via CLOB)
  - Wire up Kalshi API for live order execution
  - **BLOCKED UNTIL:** Simulation shows consistent profitability

## 🏗️ Infrastructure Scaling Plan

**Current State**: AWS Lightsail MICRO tier ($7/mo), single container
**Target**: Scale-ready architecture, potential AWS DB migration

### Current Architecture

| Component | Service | Cost | Status |
|-----------|---------|------|--------|
| Bot | Lightsail Container (MICRO) | $7/mo | ✅ Running |
| Admin UI | Vercel (Free tier) | $0 | ✅ Running |
| Database | Supabase (Free tier) | $0 | ✅ Running |
| Domain | polyparlay.io | ~$12/yr | ✅ Active |

### Scaling Milestones

| Users | Bot Tier | Database | Monthly Cost |
|-------|----------|----------|--------------|
| 0-50 | Lightsail MICRO | Supabase Free | ~$7 |
| 50-200 | Lightsail SMALL | Supabase Pro ($25) | ~$32 |
| 200-500 | Lightsail MEDIUM | Supabase Pro | ~$65 |
| 500-1K | Lightsail LARGE | AWS RDS | ~$150 |
| 1K+ | Fargate/ECS | AWS RDS Multi-AZ | ~$300+ |

### AWS Database Migration (When Ready)

- [ ] **Create RDS PostgreSQL** - us-east-1
- [ ] **Migrate Schema** - Export Supabase → Import RDS
- [ ] **Update Connection Strings** - Bot + Admin UI
- [ ] **Enable RLS Alternative** - Use application-level checks
- [ ] **Set Up Backups** - Automated daily snapshots
- [ ] **Monitoring** - CloudWatch alarms

### Why Keep Supabase (For Now)

1. **Free RLS** - Row-level security built-in
2. **Free Auth** - Could use for backup auth
3. **Realtime** - WebSocket subscriptions
4. **Edge Functions** - Serverless compute
5. **Storage** - File uploads if needed

### Future Considerations

- **Read Replicas** - For analytics queries
- **Connection Pooling** - PgBouncer for high concurrency
- **Caching** - Redis for frequently accessed data
- **CDN** - CloudFront for static assets
