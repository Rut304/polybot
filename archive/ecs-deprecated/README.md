# Archived ECS/Fargate Files

These files are no longer used. PolyBot was migrated from ECS Fargate to AWS Lightsail in December 2025 for cost savings.

## Why the migration?

- ECS Fargate: ~$50-75/month
- Lightsail: $5/month (10x cheaper)

## Archived files

- `deploy-fargate.sh` - Old deployment script for ECS
- `ecs-task-definition.json` - ECS task definition (from /aws)
- `ecs-task-definition-infra.json` - ECS task definition (from /infra)

## Current deployment

See `/LIGHTSAIL_DEPLOYMENT.md` for the current deployment method.
